# slips-challenge

node v18.7.0
Fastify v4.3.0
tap v16.3.0

To get started, clone the repository. Then:

npm install
npm test
npm start

Data is pulled from and saved to the slips.json file in the data directory. This was easiest for the scope and timeframe of this project.

Fastify is used for routes. Automated testing is done with tap in conjunction with fastify injects.
